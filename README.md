# Web-Programming-Project- Maze Solver
A web-based application to visualize maze-solving algorithms. This project allows users to select different algorithms to solve and generate mazes, demonstrating how each approach finds a path through the maze.

# Features
**Pathfinding Algorithms:**

   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
   Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
   A* (A-star)
**Maze Generation Algorithms:**
   Recursive Division
   Custom (User-defined)
**Interactive Interface:**
   Select algorithms from a dropdown menu
   Clear and Play buttons for resetting and running the visualizer
   Real-time visualization of maze generation and solving
# Installation
**Clone this repository:**
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/maze-solver.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser to launch the application.
# Usage
**Select a Maze Solving Algorithm:** Choose from BFS, Dijkstra, or A*.
**Select a Maze Generation Algorithm:** Choose from Custom or Recursive Division.
**Click "Play"** to visualize the maze-solving algorithm in action.
**Click "Clear"** to reset the grid for a new attempt.
# Project Structure

**CSS:**
  menu.css: Styles the dropdown and button menu for algorithm selection.
  grid.css: Styles the grid where the maze is displayed.
  style.css: Global styles for layout and visual consistency.
**JavaScript:**
  properties.js: Sets up properties for maze generation and solving.
  maze_generators.js: Contains functions for generating mazes.
  maze_solvers.js: Contains the maze-solving algorithms.
  menu.js: Manages menu interactions.
  visualizer.js: Handles the grid visualization.
